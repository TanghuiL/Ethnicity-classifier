# Ethnicity-classifier
A multi-label image classifier for identifying a person's ethnicity

This is an ongoing research project on whether a neural network can learn facial features that humans attribute to as belonging to different ethinicites.

The project is using the ethinicity classifications of the North American population based on the United States Bureau of the Census.

* News:

20180413 -- A very basic convolutional neural network in Keras

* ToDo:

20180413 -- Need more face images belonging to  the following ethinc groups: 

	1) Native American and Alaska Native

	2) Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
